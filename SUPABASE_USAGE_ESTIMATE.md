## 📈 Your Current Usage Estimate

### User Base Assumptions
Let's calculate for different user scenarios:

---

## Scenario 1: 50 Active Users (Conservative)

### Daily API Requests Per User

#### On-Demand Queries (No Polling):
```
User Actions Per Day:
├─ App Opens: 3 times
│  └─ Queries per open: 4 (balance, tournaments, deposits, withdrawals)
│  └─ Total: 3 × 4 = 12 requests
│
├─ Tab Switches (Window Focus): 5 times
│  └─ Queries per focus: 4
│  └─ Total: 5 × 4 = 20 requests
│
├─ Pull-to-Refresh: 2 times
│  └─ Queries per refresh: 4
│  └─ Total: 2 × 4 = 8 requests
│
├─ Component Mounts (Navigation): 10 times
│  └─ Queries per mount: 1-2
│  └─ Total: 10 × 1.5 = 15 requests
│
└─ Network Reconnects: 1 time
   └─ Queries per reconnect: 4
   └─ Total: 1 × 4 = 4 requests

Total Per User Per Day: 59 requests
```

#### Admin/Boss Actions (5 users):
```
Admin Actions Per Day:
├─ Dashboard Views: 10 times × 6 queries = 60 requests
├─ Deposit Approvals: 5 times × 3 queries = 15 requests
├─ Withdrawal Approvals: 3 times × 3 queries = 9 requests
├─ Tournament Management: 5 times × 4 queries = 20 requests
└─ User Management: 2 times × 3 queries = 6 requests

Total Per Admin Per Day: 110 requests
```

### Monthly Calculation (50 Users):

```
Players (45 users):
45 users × 59 requests/day × 30 days = 79,650 requests/month

Admins/Boss (5 users):
5 users × 110 requests/day × 30 days = 16,500 requests/month

Total Monthly Requests: 96,150 requests/month
```

**Usage: 96,150 / 2,000,000 = 4.8% of free tier limit** ✅

---

## Scenario 2: 100 Active Users (Moderate)

### Monthly Calculation:

```
Players (90 users):
90 users × 59 requests/day × 30 days = 159,300 requests/month

Admins/Boss (10 users):
10 users × 110 requests/day × 30 days = 33,000 requests/month

Total Monthly Requests: 192,300 requests/month
```

**Usage: 192,300 / 2,000,000 = 9.6% of free tier limit** ✅

---

## Scenario 3: 200 Active Users (Growing)

### Monthly Calculation:

```
Players (180 users):
180 users × 59 requests/day × 30 days = 318,600 requests/month

Admins/Boss (20 users):
20 users × 110 requests/day × 30 days = 66,000 requests/month

Total Monthly Requests: 384,600 requests/month
```

**Usage: 384,600 / 2,000,000 = 19.2% of free tier limit** ✅

---

## Scenario 4: 500 Active Users (Peak)

### Monthly Calculation:

```
Players (475 users):
475 users × 59 requests/day × 30 days = 841,500 requests/month

Admins/Boss (25 users):
25 users × 110 requests/day × 30 days = 82,500 requests/month

Total Monthly Requests: 924,000 requests/month
```

**Usage: 924,000 / 2,000,000 = 46.2% of free tier limit** ✅

---

## Scenario 5: 1000 Active Users (Maximum Safe)

### Monthly Calculation:

```
Players (975 users):
975 users × 59 requests/day × 30 days = 1,726,500 requests/month

Admins/Boss (25 users):
25 users × 110 requests/day × 30 days = 82,500 requests/month

Total Monthly Requests: 1,809,000 requests/month
```

**Usage: 1,809,000 / 2,000,000 = 90.5% of free tier limit** ⚠️

## 🎯 Realtime Subscriptions (FREE - Doesn't Count!)

### Current Implementation:
```
Per User Realtime Subscriptions:
├─ Balance Updates: 1 connection
├─ Deposits/Withdrawals: 1 connection
├─ Tournament Updates: 1 connection
└─ Total: 3 concurrent connections per user

With 100 users: 300 connections
Supabase Limit: 200 connections ⚠️
```

**Note:** You're currently using 3 subscriptions per user. With 100 users, that's 300 connections, which exceeds the 200 limit.

### Optimization Needed:
```
Recommended: Combine into 1 subscription per user
├─ Single channel for all user updates
└─ Total: 1 concurrent connection per user

With 100 users: 100 connections ✅
With 200 users: 200 connections ✅ (at limit)
```

---

## 💾 Database Storage Estimate

### Current Tables:
```
users: ~1 KB per user
user_balances: ~0.5 KB per user
tournaments: ~2 KB per tournament
registrations: ~1 KB per registration
deposits: ~1.5 KB per deposit
withdrawals: ~1.5 KB per withdrawal
transactions: ~1 KB per transaction
```

### Storage Calculation (100 users, 1 year):

```
Users & Balances:
100 users × 1.5 KB = 150 KB

Tournaments (50 per year):
50 tournaments × 2 KB = 100 KB

Registrations (avg 20 per tournament):
50 × 20 × 1 KB = 1,000 KB = 1 MB

Deposits (avg 5 per user per year):
100 × 5 × 1.5 KB = 750 KB

Withdrawals (avg 3 per user per year):
100 × 3 × 1.5 KB = 450 KB

Transactions (avg 10 per user per year):
100 × 10 × 1 KB = 1,000 KB = 1 MB

Total Storage: ~3.5 MB
```

**Usage: 3.5 MB / 500 MB = 0.7% of free tier limit** ✅

---

## 🔥 Comparison: Before vs After Optimization

### BEFORE (With Polling):

```
Per User Per Day:
├─ Balance polling (every 3s): 28,800 requests
├─ Transactions polling (every 15s): 5,760 requests
├─ Deposits polling (every 12s): 7,200 requests
└─ Withdrawals polling (every 12s): 7,200 requests

Total: 48,960 requests/day/user

With 100 users:
100 × 48,960 × 30 = 146,880,000 requests/month
Usage: 7,344% of free tier ❌ EXCEEDS BY 73x!
```

### AFTER (Zero Polling):

```
Per User Per Day:
└─ On-demand only: 59 requests

Total: 59 requests/day/user

With 100 users:
100 × 59 × 30 = 177,000 requests/month
Usage: 8.85% of free tier ✅ SAFE!

Reduction: 99.88% fewer API calls!
```
