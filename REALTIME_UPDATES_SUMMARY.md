## Real-Time Update Mechanisms

### 1. **Polling (Automatic Refetch)**
- Balance: Every 5 seconds
- Boss Counts: Every 3 seconds
- Tournaments: Every 10 seconds
- User Registrations: Every 8 seconds
- Deposits/Withdrawals: Every 12 seconds
- Transactions: Every 15 seconds
- Activities: Every 20 seconds

### 2. **Supabase Real-Time Subscriptions**
- Balance changes trigger immediate refetch
- Tournament changes trigger immediate refetch
- Registration changes trigger immediate refetch
- Deposit/Withdrawal status changes trigger immediate refetch

### 3. **User Action Triggers**
- Window focus: Refetch all data
- Component mount: Refetch all data
- Network reconnect: Refetch all data

### 4. **Error Recovery**
- Automatic resubscription on channel errors (5s delay)
- Exponential backoff for failed queries
- Comprehensive error logging

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
1. **Stale Time Configuration**: Different stale times based on data criticality
2. **Background Refetching**: Continues updating even when tab is not focused
3. **Conditional Queries**: Only run when userId exists (`enabled: !!userId`)
4. **Active Query Refetch**: Only refetch active queries to save resources

### Network Efficiency
- Polling intervals balanced between freshness and network usage
- Critical data (balance, boss counts) polls more frequently
- Historical data (transactions, activities) polls less frequently
- Supabase real-time subscriptions reduce unnecessary polling

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Path Testing
1. **Balance Updates**
   - Make a deposit → Check balance updates in header, wallet, dashboard
   - Boss approves deposit → Verify instant balance update
   - Make withdrawal → Check balance deduction

2. **Tournament Updates**
   - Create tournament → Verify appears in lists immediately
   - Register for tournament → Check slot count updates
   - Admin updates tournament → Verify changes reflect instantly

3. **Transaction Updates**
   - Perform any transaction → Check transaction history updates
   - Verify balance after transaction updates correctly

### Edge Cases
1. **Network Issues**
   - Disconnect network → Reconnect → Verify data refetches
   - Slow network → Verify retry logic works

2. **Multiple Tabs**
   - Open multiple tabs → Make changes in one → Verify others update

3. **Background Updates**
   - Minimize tab → Make changes → Maximize → Verify updates occurred

## Console Logging

All real-time subscriptions now log:
- Subscription setup
- Data updates received
- Subscription status changes
- Error conditions
- Resubscription attempts

Check browser console for debugging real-time updates.
