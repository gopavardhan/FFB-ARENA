## üéØ Quick Verification Checklist

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Check Database Tables Exist

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `xukowavzxgnjukalxjjv`

2. **Navigate to Table Editor**
   - Click "Table Editor" in left sidebar
   - Verify these 6 new tables exist:
     - ‚úÖ `player_statistics`
     - ‚úÖ `achievements`
     - ‚úÖ `user_achievements`
     - ‚úÖ `tournament_brackets`
     - ‚úÖ `teams`
     - ‚úÖ `team_members`

3. **Check Table Structure**
   - Click on each table
   - Verify columns match the migration

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Check Default Achievements

1. **Open `achievements` table**
2. **Verify 15 default achievements exist:**
   - First Victory (common)
   - Tournament Veteran (common)
   - Top 3 Finish (rare)
   - Champion (rare)
   - Hat Trick (epic)

3. **Check achievement data:**
   - All have `is_active = true`
   - Points are assigned correctly
   - Categories are set (tournament, earnings, social, special)
   - Rarities are set (common, rare, epic, legendary)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Test Statistics Feature

#### A. Check if Statistics Page Loads
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/statistics
2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Page loads without errors
   - Shows "No statistics available yet" (if no data)
   - OR shows your stats if you've played tournaments

#### B. Verify Statistics Data
1. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Refresh the page**
4. **Look for these API calls:**
   - `player_statistics` query
   - `recent_performance` query (if implemented)
   - `leaderboard` query

5. **Check Response:**
   - Status: 200 OK
   - Data structure matches TypeScript types
   - No errors in console

#### C. Test with Supabase SQL Editor
```sql
-- Check if player_statistics table has data
SELECT * FROM player_statistics LIMIT 10;

-- Check if your user has statistics
SELECT * FROM player_statistics 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';

-- If no data, create test data:
INSERT INTO player_statistics (
  user_id,
  total_tournaments,
  tournaments_won,
  tournaments_top3,
  total_earnings,
  total_spent,
  win_rate,
  average_placement,
  best_placement,
  current_streak,
  longest_streak
) VALUES (
  'YOUR_USER_ID',
  10,
  3,
  5,
  5000.00,
  2000.00,
  30.00,
  5.5,
  1,
  2,
  3
);
```

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Test Achievements Feature

#### A. Check if Achievements Page Loads
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/achievements
2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Page loads without errors
   - Shows all 15 achievements
   - Locked achievements show lock icon
   - Filters work (category, rarity, status)

#### B. Verify Achievements Data
1. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Refresh the page**
4. **Look for these API calls:**
   - `achievements` query (gets all achievements)
   - `user_achievements` query (gets user's progress)

5. **Check Response:**
   - All 15 achievements returned
   - User progress data (if any)
   - No errors in console

#### C. Test Achievement Unlock
```sql
-- Check user achievements
SELECT * FROM user_achievements 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';

-- Manually unlock an achievement for testing:
INSERT INTO user_achievements (
  user_id,
  achievement_id,
  progress,
  is_unlocked,
  unlocked_at
) VALUES (
  'YOUR_USER_ID',
  (SELECT id FROM achievements WHERE name = 'First Victory'),
  1,
  true,
  NOW()
);

-- Check if it appears as unlocked in UI
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Test Teams Feature

#### A. Check if Teams Page Loads
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/teams
2. **Expected Behavior:**

   - Shows "No teams found" (if no teams exist)
   - "Create Team" button visible
   - Search and filters work

#### B. Test Team Creation
1. **Click "Create Team" button**
2. **Fill in the form:**
   - Team Name: "Test Team"

   - Description: "This is a test team"
3. **Click "Create Team"**
4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Success toast notification
   - Team appears in "My Teams" tab
   - You are the captain

#### C. Verify in Database
```sql
-- Check if team was created
SELECT * FROM teams 
WHERE captain_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';

-- Check if you're a member
SELECT * FROM team_members 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';

-- Check team stats
SELECT 
  t.*,
  COUNT(tm.id) as member_count
FROM teams t
LEFT JOIN team_members tm ON t.id = tm.team_id
WHERE t.captain_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
GROUP BY t.id;
```

#### D. Test Team Join/Leave
1. **Create a second user account** (or use existing)
2. **Browse teams**
3. **Click "Join Team" on a team**
4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Success notification
   - Team appears in "My Teams"
   - Member count increases

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Test Brackets Feature

#### A. Check if Bracket Page Loads

   (Replace :id with actual tournament ID)
3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Page loads without errors
   - Shows "Bracket not available" (if no bracket)
   - OR shows bracket tree if bracket exists

#### B. Create Test Bracket Data
```sql
-- Check if tournament exists
SELECT id, name, status FROM tournaments LIMIT 5;

-- Create test bracket for a tournament
INSERT INTO tournament_brackets (
  tournament_id,
  round_number,
  match_number,
  player1_id,
  player2_id,
  winner_id,
  player1_score,
  player2_score,
  status
) VALUES 
-- Round 1, Match 1
(
  'TOURNAMENT_ID',
  1,
  1,
  'PLAYER1_ID',
  'PLAYER2_ID',
  'PLAYER1_ID',
  10,
  5,
  'completed'
),
-- Round 1, Match 2
(
  'TOURNAMENT_ID',
  1,
  2,
  'PLAYER3_ID',
  'PLAYER4_ID',
  NULL,
  0,
  0,
  'pending'
);

-- Verify bracket was created
SELECT * FROM tournament_brackets 
WHERE tournament_id = 'TOURNAMENT_ID'
ORDER BY round_number, match_number;
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 7: Test Database Functions

#### A. Test Update Statistics Function
```sql
-- This function should be called automatically after tournaments
-- Test it manually:
SELECT update_player_statistics('YOUR_USER_ID');

-- Check if statistics were updated
SELECT * FROM player_statistics 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

#### B. Test Check Achievements Function
```sql
-- This function checks if user unlocked any achievements
SELECT check_and_unlock_achievements('YOUR_USER_ID');

-- Check if any achievements were unlocked
SELECT 
  ua.*,
  a.name,
  a.description
FROM user_achievements ua
JOIN achievements a ON ua.achievement_id = a.id
WHERE ua.user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
AND ua.is_unlocked = true;
```

#### C. Test Create Withdrawal Function
```sql
-- This function creates withdrawal and deducts balance
-- Test with small amount:
SELECT create_withdrawal_request(
  'YOUR_USER_ID',
  50.00,
  'test@upi'
);

-- Check if withdrawal was created
SELECT * FROM withdrawals 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check if balance was deducted
SELECT * FROM user_balances 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

## üîç Advanced Verification

### Check Real-time Subscriptions

1. **Open Browser DevTools**
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Look for these messages:**
   ```
   Setting up realtime subscription for user balance
   Setting up realtime subscription for deposits/withdrawals
   Setting up realtime subscription for tournaments
   ```

4. **Test Real-time Updates:**
   - Open two browser windows
   - Make a change in one (e.g., create a team)
   - Verify it appears in the other window automatically

---

### Check API Performance

1. **Open Browser DevTools**
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Filter by "Fetch/XHR"**
4. **Check:**
   - All requests return 200 OK
   - Response times < 1 second
   - No 401 (unauthorized) errors
   - No 500 (server) errors

---

### Check Database Indexes

```sql
-- Verify indexes exist for performance
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  indexname
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename IN (
  'player_statistics',
  'achievements',
  'user_achievements',
  'tournament_brackets',
  'teams',
  'team_members'
);
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "No data available"
**Cause:** Tables are empty
**Solution:** Create test data using SQL queries above

### Issue 2: "Permission denied"
**Cause:** RLS policies not set correctly
**Solution:** Check Supabase RLS policies for new tables

### Issue 3: "Function not found"
**Cause:** Database functions not deployed
**Solution:** Re-run migration or create functions manually

### Issue 4: "Real-time not working"
**Cause:** Supabase real-time not enabled
**Solution:** Enable real-time in Supabase dashboard for new tables
