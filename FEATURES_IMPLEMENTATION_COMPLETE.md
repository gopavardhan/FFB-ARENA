## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

**Option A: Via Supabase CLI**
```bash
supabase db push
```

**Option B: Via Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard
2. Open `supabase/migrations/20251007000000_add_new_features.sql`
3. Copy all contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"

### Step 2: Regenerate Supabase Types

```bash
# Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your actual project ID
supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

This will:
- ✅ Fix all TypeScript errors
- ✅ Add new table types
- ✅ Update type definitions

### Step 3: Verify Migration

Check that tables were created:
```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN (
  'player_statistics',
  'achievements',
  'user_achievements',
  'tournament_brackets',
  'teams',
  'team_members'
);
```

Should return 6 rows.

### Step 4: Test Hooks

The hooks are ready to use immediately after migration:

```typescript
// Test player statistics
const { data: stats } = usePlayerStatistics(userId);

// Test achievements
const { data: achievements } = useAchievementsWithProgress(userId);

// Test brackets
const { data: bracket } = useTournamentBracket(tournamentId);

// Test teams
const { data: teams } = useTeams();
```
