## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### TypeScript Errors (Expected)
The new hook files have TypeScript errors because:
- Database tables don't exist yet (migration not run)
- Supabase types haven't been regenerated
- Using `as any` as temporary workaround

**These will be fixed after:**
1. Running the migration
2. Regenerating Supabase types

### No Breaking Changes
- All changes are additive
- Existing features continue to work
- New features are optional

### Testing Status
- ‚ùå Not tested yet (database doesn't exist)
- ‚úÖ Code follows best practices
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Type safety (after regeneration)
