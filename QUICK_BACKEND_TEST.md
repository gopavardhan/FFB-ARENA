# 🚀 Quick Backend Test Guide

## Simple 5-Minute Backend Verification

Follow these steps to verify your backend is working:

---

## ✅ Step 1: Check Browser Console (2 minutes)

### Open Your App
1. Go to: http://localhost:8081/ (or 8080)

```

### Check Network Tab
1. Click **Network** tab in DevTools

---

## 🔍 Quick Database Check (Optional)

### Check Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **"Table Editor"**
4. **Verify these tables exist:**
   - ✅ player_statistics
   - ✅ achievements (should have 15 rows)

   - ✅ teams
   - ✅ team_members

5. **Click on "achievements" table**

```
If count is 0, re-run the migration.

### Issue: "Can't create team"
**Fix:** Check browser console for error. Likely RLS policy issue.
